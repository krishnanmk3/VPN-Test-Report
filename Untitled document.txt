Conclusion
Proton VPN’s free plan provides robust privacy for casual browsing but suffers from significant speed reductions. It excels in security (AES-256, no leaks) and transparency (audited no-logs), making it a top free choice. However, streaming, torrenting, or low-latency tasks require paid plans.
Recommendation: Use Proton VPN Free for email/public Wi-Fi. Upgrade to Plus for streaming/gaming.
